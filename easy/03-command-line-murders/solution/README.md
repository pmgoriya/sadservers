### My solution

1. First grep CLUE from the mystery directory.
2. Next breakdown all the 3 clues.
    - First find out people who have names in all the 4 id card groups.
    - Next time to find out what the witness saw and told in her interview.
3. Figure out the people with the exact car and number, and eliminate people below 6'0 and then eliminate people based on the id card group names.
4. Check the interview given by these people. To reach to the relevant interviews check in the people directory and their addresses.
